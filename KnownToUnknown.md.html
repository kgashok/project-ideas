      <p>Hey Ashok -<br>
Imagine you started playing a brand new video game that your friend recommended. You’re having fun and then he shares with you a secret. <strong>A cheat code to skip straight to Level 50.</strong><br>
You jump at the opportunity…<br>
Up up down down left right left right B A start<br>
And a few seconds later you die from a single blow dealt by an enemy.<br>
You try it again, and the same thing happens.<br>
So what did you do wrong?<br>
<strong>You didn’t build the right foundation.</strong><br>
You can’t just skip to Level 50 with your Level 1 weapons and armor and expect to hold your own.<br>
After all, what was actually supposed to happen in all those levels that you skipped?<br>
Well you were supposed to level up.<br>
You were supposed to upgrade your weapons.<br>
You were supposed to increase your HP.<br>
And when you don’t do that… you don’t stand a chance!</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s so easy to get stuck when preparing for coding interview. It’s so easy to get overwhelmed.<br>
And one of the most common problems <strong>I see is students trying to jump straight to Level 50 without putting in the work to get there</strong>.<br>
If you’re struggling on Easy Leetcode problems, of course you’re going to struggle on the hard ones.<br>
If you don’t understand DFS, how are you going to understand minimum spanning trees or max flow algorithms?<br>
If you go too far out of your comfort zone, you’re going to struggle NO MATTER WHAT.<br>
So today I want to give you a strategy that you can apply to whatever you’re learning, whether it’s a new data structure, a specific algorithm, or how to solve a random interview question:</p>
<p><strong>Start with the known and build into the unknown.</strong><br>
Here’s how this works.<br>
Let’s imagine that you want to learn about DFS and you know nothing about it.<br>
First, you start with the simplest version. Simply take a tree and determine whether or not it contains a specific node.<br>
Essentially, implement boolean <code>containsValue(TreeNode root, int val)</code>.<br>
You can start by looking at existing solutions. Maybe you walk through the code line by line. You do whatever it takes to understand the code as best as you can.<br>
And what do you do then?<br>
You implement a SMALL variation on this.<br>
Maybe in addition to finding whether the value is in the tree you also want to print out all of the nodes you’ve visited. Maybe you want to find the path.<br>
And then you keep iterating.<br>
Try printing out the values in different orders (post-order, pre-order, post-order, etc).<br>
Try finding the path between two different nodes in the tree.<br>
<strong><code>What if rather than a tree it's a graph?</code></strong><br>
As you work through each variation, it forces you to better understand exactly how DFS actually works.<br>
No more memorizing the code. Now you actually can create it from scratch.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now this technique doesn’t just work for DFS. This simple strategy works for anything you are trying to learn.<br>
The key is to <strong>start with what you DO know and slowly work your way into the unknown</strong>.</p>
<p>I encourage you to test this out for yourself and let me know how it works for you!</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Sam</p>
