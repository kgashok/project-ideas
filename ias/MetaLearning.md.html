<p>“<strong>Meta learning</strong> is a branch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition" title="Metacognit.io/).n">metacognition</a> concerned with learning about one’s own learning and learning processes.”</p>
<ul>
<li>meta-learning as “being aware of and taking control of one’s own learning”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of meta learning was later used by John Biggs (1985) to describe the state of “being aware of and taking control of one’s own learning”.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning#cite_note-2">[2]</a>  	  - You can define meta learning as an awareness and understanding of the phenomenon of learning itself as opposed to subject knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implicit in this definition is the learner’s perception of the learning context, which includes knowing what the expectations of the discipline are and, more narrowly, the demands of a given learning task.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A student who has a high level of meta learning awareness is able to assess the effectiveness of her/his learning approach and regulate it according to the demands of the learning task.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="two-specific-experiences">Two Specific Experiences</h2>
<p>During the COVID-2019 lockdown, we had the opportunity to deliver two learning experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coding Camps - A 20-hour deep, immersive,  camps over two days to learn about <strong>Indirection</strong> and <strong>Recursion</strong>. It helped transfer over 60% of what you need to know about those concepts through carefully curated problem sets (<a href="http://j.mp/pCampKG">http://j.mp/pCampKG</a> and <a href="http://j.mp/rTutorial">http://j.mp/rTutorial</a>) presented using a feedback-rich auto-grading system (aka CloudCoder).</li>
<li>Integrative Learning - combining disjoint concepts ranging from <strong>algorithms</strong> (sorting), <strong>constructs</strong> (recursion, pointers) and <strong>data structures</strong> (structures, linked list) to to learn recursive sorting of a linked list elevates the understanding of each of the concept individually and collectively.
<ul>
<li>After presenting the code for the topic in Unit 4, students were challenged to solve a debtable “an-out-of_portion” coding exercise which required them to recall their knowledge of previous concepts from other units and use them in an integrated manner.</li>

<p>Now, machines are also beginning to <strong>“learn how to learn”</strong> themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the context of AI systems, meta-learning can be simply be defined as the ability to acquire knowledge versatility. As humans, we are able to acquire multiple tasks simultaneously with minimum information. We can recognize a new type of object by seeing a single picture of it or we can learn complex, multi-task activities such as driving or piloting an airplane at once. While AI agents can master really complex tasks, they require massive amounts of training on any atomic subtasks and they remained incredibly bad at multi-tasking.
<ul>
<li>So the path to knowledge versatility requires AI agents to “learn how to learn” or, to used a more obnoxious term, <strong>to meta-learn</strong>.</li>
