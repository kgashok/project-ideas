## Pointers 

![Image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0Bwu4iGPfYEufWVlRTmg1SlB5OWMyV2xOZ0gwamxqN2tlM3pJ)

Very important counter-perspective to read:   
  - "I think the main barrier to understanding pointers is bad teachers." http://bit.ly/pointersAndBadTeachers  
	  - That they are _nothing more than memory addresses_, or that they allow you to point to _arbitrary locations_.
  - The Pointer conspiracy - http://bit.ly/pointerConspiracy

### Integers and Integer variables (_Known_) 
|Item | Interchangeable with  | Description | Example |
|:----------|:----------:|:------------|:-------------------|
|Integer	| Whole number | Any whole number value from 1 to 100000| 9930
|Integer variable | - | a variable type that can be initialized with _only_ a decimal,(e.g. **2220**) or octal or hexadecimal value | int a_variable = 2220; | 


### Pointers and pointer variables (_Unknown_)

|Item | Interchangeable with | Description | Example |
|:----------|:----------:|:------------|:-------------------|
|Pointer	| A value; memory location address |A valid memory location value in hexadecimal | `0x400694`|
|Pointer variable | Pointer | a variable type that can be initialized _only_ with a memory address (_a.k.a._ **Pointer**, usually represented by a hexadecimal value) of other variables and not any integer (for e.g. decimal **2220**) | int* **pA**; pA = &a; | 
|Pointer type | Data type | refers to the type of the data retrieved or stored when *de-referencing* (using the `*` operator) a pointer variable | **int*** p; **char*** c; **float*** f;  | 
|Integer pointer | Integer Pointer Variable | When *de-referencing* (using the `*` operator) on the left hand side (LHS) is used with the variable, it stores integer in the memory location; when de-referencing on the RHS, the value stored in the memory location is retrieved  | **int*** pInteger; *pInteger = 300; | 
|Memory location value | Memory Address | Any physical memory location which can be accessed by the CPU | Any hexadecimal number between a range, say 0x1000 -> 0x10000 |
|Memory variable | Data variable | A human-defined name that might refer to one or more memory locations depending upon the type | **int a;** // 4 bytes starting at `0xbf943434` |
|Dereferencing | - | Using the `*` operator, retrieve value in the memory location pointed to by the pointer variable; when used on the LHS of an assignment statement, it stores the RHS value in the memory location | `*pB + 1` // retrieve value and add one | 
|Pointer in the LHS (left hand side) of assignment statement | - | Store data in the memory location pointed to | `*ppA = 23 + 39023;` 
|Pointer in the RHS (right hand side) of assignment statement | - | Retrieve data from the memory location pointed to | `int v = *ppA + 23;`  
|Invalid pointer assignments | - | Assigning an integer value as the address of a pointer | ppA = 23; // illegal because `23` is not a valid memory location | 
|Valid pointer assignments | - | Assigning a pointer variable to another pointer variable | If pA and pB are pointer variables, `pA = pB;`  |
|Pass by value | Call by value | Function arguments in [C][call by value in C] and [Java][call by value in Java] are strictly passed on as parameters to the called function _only by value_ | True or false? Read the [tutorial][call by value tutorial]
|Call by reference | Pass by reference | When functions are called with arguments that are either pointers (C) or references (C++) | True or false? **TBD**
|Reference | reference variable | An alias for another variable that cannot be re-assigned (C++). Primarily introduced to allow for [operator overloading][operator overloading why?]. | `int a; int& b = a;`

## Same Asterisk, Different Meaning
![asterisk](http://j.mp/confusingPointers)


## Code Quiz
Read [Same Asterisk, Different Meaning](#same-asterisk-different-meaning) before you attempt the problems below.

## Pointer Snippet
Is the following code snippet valid? ***If*** yes, explain what the following code snippet is trying to do.

   ```c
    int *ip;
    ip = (int *)6;
    *ip = 0xFF;
 ``` 
    
## Quiz 0 - Pointer basics 

```c
int a[10]; // defining an array
assert(a == &a[0]); 

int *b = &a[9]; 
assert(a != b-9); 	
```

The 1st `assert` in the above code snippet will 
1. Pass 
2. Fail 
3. Indeterminable 
4. Won't compile 

The 2nd `assert` in the above code snippet will 
1. Pass 
2. Fail 
3. Indeterminable 
4. Won't compile 



## Quiz 1  - Pointer basics
```cpp
int b; 
int* pA;
int* pB = &b; 
pA = pB;
printf ("%d is the value pointed to by pA\n", *pA); 
```
The string displayed is 
```
1. "pB is the value pointed to by pA"
2. "0 is the value pointed to by pA"
3. "2323443 is the value pointed to by pA"
4. Non-determinable because integer `b` is not initialized 
```

## Quiz 2  - Pointer basics
```cpp
char buf[] = "this is a long string"; 
char* pBuf = buf; 
char* pBuf2; 
pBuf2 = pBuf;   // valid pointer to pointer assignment 
char* anotherP = (char *)malloc (sizeof(buf) * sizeof(char) ); 
*anotherP = *pBuf; 
printf ("%s is the contents of anotherP\n", anotherP); 
printf ("%c is the contents of anotherP\n", *anotherP);

```
The 2-line output in the display is: 
```cpp
1. "this is a long string"  and "t"
2. "t" and "t"
3. Non-determinable and "t" 
```

## Quiz 3  - Swap using Pointers
```cLang
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 

void swap (int*, int*); // declaring swap 
int* get_a_number();    // uses malloc() to dynamically allocate integers

void swap(int *q,int *p)  // definition of swap 
{
    // Step 0 your code goes below
}

int main ()
{
    int *a = get_a_number();   
    int *b = get_a_number();   
    int  c = *get_a_number();  
    int  d = *get_a_number();  

    // Step 0 implement swap function 
    
    // Step 1 call the swap functions appropriately with a & b

    // Step 2 call the swap function appropriately with c & d

    // Step 3 print the swapped values --------
    printf ("%d %d %d %d", *a,*b, c, d);
    return 0;
}

int* get_a_number()
{
    int* number = (int*) malloc ( sizeof (int) ); 
    scanf("%d", number);
    return number;
}

```

Assume you've entered the appropriate code for the `swap` function above. The correct code for `Step 1 and Step 2` is: 

1. `swap (&a, &b)` and `swap (&c, &d)`  
2. `swap (*a, *b)` and `swap (&c, &d)`   
3. `swap (a, b)` and `swap (c, d)`  
4. `swap (a, b)` and `swap (&c, &d)`  
5. None of the above   


## Quiz 4  - Bug Finder 

![substring](https://rawgit.com/kgisl/project-ideas/master/ias/subString.png)

The above program is almost **perfect** in that it defines a `substring` function which returns a substring of the input ("CatDogMonkey") starting from index 3 and of length 4.  Except there is one small yet major flaw. What is the error? 

## Quiz 5  - Printer Arithmetic

![arithmetic](https://rawgit.com/kgisl/project-ideas/master/ias/printerArithmetic.png)

### Question 5.1
If the output at Line 19 (the first `printf` statement) is: 
`0x400694 0xfff000ba0 0xfff000b60`

then the output at Line 20 (the next `printf` statement) is: 

1. `0x400694 0xfff000ba0 0xfff000b60`
2. `0x400698 0xfff000ba4 0xfff000b64`
2. `0x400695 0xfff000ba4 0xfff000b74`
3. None of the above 

### Question 5.2
With reference to `Line 24`, the output will be: 

1. `0xfff000ba1`
2. Compiler will not compile
3. Undefined behavior
4. Any one of the above
	 
Spoiler Alert: http://stackoverflow.com/a/3524270/307454

### Quiz 5.3 
The only kind of arithmetic that is allowed between two pointers: 
1. Addition and Subtraction of two pointers
2. Multiplication and Division of two pointers
3. Both the above
4. Only subtraction between two pointers

### Quiz 5.4
![output](http://j.mp/outputGuessing)

The output of the above program is: 

1. `3 3` 
2. `12 3` 
3. `0 0` 
4. `12  <indeterminable>`

# What next?

- Use [Pointer Koans](https://github.com/kgashok/CppKoans/blob/master/koans/koan05_pointers.cpp) to reflect on pointer concepts by reading/writing simple pointer code
	- > ![koans](http://j.mp/pointerKoans)
- Go through the tutorial at https://overiq.com/c-programming/101/pointer-basics-in-c/
- Conceptual understanding of Pointers (_aka_ **indirection**, is one of the 7 fundamental constructs http://j.mp/constructAnalogy) is best achieved by doing a lot of pointer problems.

# Lecture Notes
_For some reason most people seem to be born without the part of the brain that understands pointers. This is an aptitude thing, not a skill thing – it requires a complex form of doubly-indirected thinking that some people just can’t do._ - **Joel Spolsky**

1. **What is a pointer?** It is a number.

2. **What is a valid pointer versus invalid pointer?** A valid pointer is a hexadecimal number, very often, a 8 digit hexadecimal number e.g. `0x1239ffb9`. It also refers to a valid memory addresses that is accessible to the CPU of a computer. An invalid pointer is a hexadecimal value (for e.g. `0x10`) which is either not accessible by a user written software program (because that memory location stores code that is part of the BIOS code of the computer) or a hexadecimal value which is not relevant to the memory addresses of a computer. 

3. **What is a pointer variable?** A variable that is used to store a valid pointer value. 
4. **How is a pointer variable defined?** The same naming conventions (மரபு, பழக்கம்) that apply to a variable, apply to a pointer variable. However there is one special requirement - and that is it needs to be preceded by a `*`. Valid pointer variable names are `*name`, `*value1` and `*node1` 

5. **How is a pointer variable initialized**? The right hand side (RHS) of the assignment statement must be a valid memory address (usually a hexadecimal value). A `null pointer variable` is a pointer variable which stores `0` as the pointer value, usually as part of its initialization. 

6. **How and when to deference a pointer**? A pointer when de-referenced (using the `*` operator) on the right hand side (RHS) of an assignment **retrieves** data from the memory location it is pointed to. A pointer when de-referenced on the left hand side (LHS) results in the **storing** of data happens in the memory location it points to. 


## Lecture Notes 2 

 - **Double Pointers** - pointer variables that store the memory location of another pointer is called a double pointer. And naming convention requires that `**` be used when defining such double pointer variables 
    - http://j.mp/doubleSwap - for double pointer coding practice 
    - http://j.mp/dPalindromeKG - Practice 2 on Palindrome checking
    - http://j.mp/doublePointerSort - for a real-world use case
 - Use **Pointers to operate** on Linear data structures (like Linked lists, and Queues) 
    - Solve problems in CloudCoder (such as `create`, `traverse`, etc ) from http://j.mp/pointerKITE 

# Context

- Dynamic memory management (malloc, memset) - **pointers** are used as a handle for storing such memory locations.
- Data structures like linked list, queues
	- **Pointers** that are require to traverse and manipulate linear data structures 
- Data structures like trees, graphs
	- **Pointers** and recursive functions/algorithms which are required to manipulate recursive data structures
	- finding the shortest path from Destination A to Destination B 
	- searching and inserting data into data structures for efficient retrieval and modifications
